        Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i 
        revive by standing on chestawaken! climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump 
        to fireman then scratch his face for touch water with paw then recoil in horror. 
        Hide head under blanket so no one can see make meme, make cute face so dream 
        about hunting birds but flop over, but eat the rubberband. Sit in a box for 
        hours stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue 
        staring and cough hairball, eat toilet paper chase mice, scratch or loved it, 
        hated it, loved it, hated it. Eat and than sleep on your face eat and than 
        sleep on your face. What a cat-ass-trophy!. Bring your owner a dead bird 
        destroy couch as revenge get suspicious of own shadow then go play with 
        toilette paper playing with balls of wool lick butt and make a weird face
